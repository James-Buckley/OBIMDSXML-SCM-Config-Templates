Oracle BI 11g MDS XML Templates Project
==============================

This project contains configuration templates to leverage with the Oracle BI MDS XML Source Control Management functionality.

As described in a recent article on OTN, these templates allow the Oracle BI Administration Tool to pass execution commands to the SCM tool of choice. By default only configuration templates for SVN and ADE are provided with the full server installation of Oracle BI 11g.  This project location provides a resource to those developers leveraging the client tools as well as a reference for thos desiring to use other SCM products.
